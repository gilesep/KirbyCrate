KirbyCrate is a copy of BrawlCrate, but for modding Kirby's Return To DreamLand (wii) instead of SmashBrothersBrawl.

Changes made:
- Removed prebuild steps from projects, to make it build under VS 2022.
- Unloaded updater project
- Added padding round the form and made the background pink.
- Added a blank default pane with a kirby logo in the top left.
- Tweaked main form's title and icon from BrawlCrate to KirbyCrate
- Added a basic fix for the External folder problem.

Possible Futute changes:
- Up all projects to use the .NET 4.8 runtime.
- Try to fix the Extenal folder problem via a new XBIN node instead.
